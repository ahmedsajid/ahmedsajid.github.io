The platform helps worker find flexible work based on their schedule.\nPart of a small CloudOps team using IaC and DevOps approach in supporting Wonolo's AWS Infrastructure.

      "highlights": [
        "Improved Buildkite CI build time by deploying AWS Lambda functions to manage queues and workload. Previous to this change, Autoscaling was configured based on CPU utilization, which meant until the threshold was met, scale-out even didn't take place causing long wait times of sometimes up to 5 minutes. With the Lambda functions deployed, wait time was cut down to 45 second on average. This reduction in wait times resulted in quicker builds, which provided quicker deployments to production.",
        "Upgraded Wonolo's SaaS Platform AWS Aurora PostgresSQL DB upgrade from 10 to 14. This require months of testing to ensure that the critical Production database upgrade goes smoothly, the data corruption wouldn't occur and the application still worked with the newer version of PostgresSQL engine.",

        "As a cost saving measure, worked to remove older generation EC2 instances from terraform deployments. Moved DB clusters to AWS Graviton instances, taking advantage of better price performance. Also, eliminated the need for AWS Data Migration Service for syncing production data to lower environment by switching to `pgsync` an open source tool which could be run on existing infrastructure at no additional cost.",
        "Performed several AWS Account migration of Wonolo acquired businesses. This includes moving services like AWS S3, Athena and MongoDB to Wonolo managed accounts. As part of this effort, also worked on migrating Git repositories from gitlab.com to github.com.",
        "Wonolo utilizes AWS EC2 spot instances for running production workload to keep infrastructure costs low. The production workload runs on HashiCorp Nomad which has issues with handling EC2 spot interruptions where AWS terminates the instances when their platform needs capacity. I wrote a custom spot interruption handler to ensure that when spot interruption notice was issues, Nomad worker was cordoned to avoid scheduling workload on the node providing a graceful termination scenario. This custom handler queried AWS EC2 Metadata endpoint to determine termination time, and if one was provided the node was set to be ineligible to run any new workload while draining existing workload avoiding sudden loss in workload capacity.",
        "Part of the team project to migrate from Chef to Ansible. Wrote the initial Packer Build AMI for creating base images which included running Ansible using `ansible-pull` method. Later worked on writing Ansible Roles for deployment of Buildkite Agents and OpenTelemetry Collector including Molecule testing framework and goss.rocks server validation tooling.",
        "Improved overall monitoring posture by integration CloudWatch for sending Slack and OnCall alerts for critical resources. Also setup metrics and dashboard in Grafana for AWS resources and CI."
