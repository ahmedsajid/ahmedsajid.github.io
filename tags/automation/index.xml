      <description>The most popular IaC tool at this point is HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s Terraform. However during my usual internet browsing, I found another Infrastructure-as-Code tool Pulumi. Its been around for years at this point but I only discovered it very recently.
Pulumi achieves the same thing, Infrastructure-as-Code. However, it uses a different approach. Instead of having to write Terraform HCL files, you can use your favorite programming language such as Python or Go to write code for your infrastructure.</description>
