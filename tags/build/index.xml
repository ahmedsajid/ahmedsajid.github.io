      <description>Early on in my career I was responsible for compiling scientific software, installing them on HPC clusters to be used by scientists for their job runs. This is where I learned the 3 most used commands used when building and installing software. These ere configure, make and make install, as simple as that.
Fast forward years, code is longer just writing C or C++ code, these days most of the new software code is written in Golang, Python or Java just to name a few.</description>
