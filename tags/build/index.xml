      <description>TL;DR, Jenkins EC2 plugin has the option for worker AMIs to be selected based on Tags and NOT just a hardcoded AMI ID. This comes in handy when you have an automated build pushing out AMIs with the same tags on regular basis, eliminating the need for manually updating hardcoded AMI to latest version in Jenkins EC2 cloud configuration.
Long version&amp;hellip;&amp;hellip;
Most companies managing their own Jenkins CI Build system on AWS Cloud must be familiar with the ec2-plugin.</description>

      <description>Early on in my career I was responsible for compiling scientific software, installing them on HPC clusters to be used by scientists for their job runs. This is where I learned the 3 most used commands used when building and installing software. These ere configure, make and make install, as simple as that.
Fast forward years, code is longer just writing C or C++ code, these days most of the new software code is written in Golang, Python or Java just to name a few.</description>
