      <description>Early on in my career I was responsible for compiling scientific software, installing them on HPC clusters to be used by scientists for their job runs. This is where I learned the 3 most used commands used when building and installing software. These ere configure, make and make install, as simple as that.
Fast forward years, code is longer just writing C or C++ code, these days most of the new software code is written in Golang, Python or Java just to name a few.</description>

      <description>The most popular IaC tool at this point is HashiCorp&amp;rsquo;s Terraform. However during my usual internet browsing, I found another Infrastructure-as-Code tool Pulumi. Its been around for years at this point but I only discovered it very recently.
Pulumi achieves the same thing, Infrastructure-as-Code. However, it uses a different approach. Instead of having to write Terraform HCL files, you can use your favorite programming language such as Python or Go to write code for your infrastructure.</description>

      <description>While working on home server automation, I came across the awesome Open Source project healthchecks.
I had been looking for a simple way to monitoring my Ansible home automation setup that is triggered via cron and send me alerts if my home automation takes longer than a set interval or just fails.
healthchecks.io, the service for healthchecks project, is an extremely simple dashboard for setting up monitoring. It also has integration with alerting systems as well as commonly used communication tools such as Teams, Slack, Signal and numerous others.</description>

      <title>Immediate Kubernetes Certification Exam results</title>

      <description>I recently passed CKA and CKAD (yay me!).
Being that I&amp;rsquo;m very impatient and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t wait the 24 hours for my result. For people who haven&amp;rsquo;t attempted the Certified Kubernetes exams, there&amp;rsquo;s a 24 hour period between completing your exam and receiving the results.
So after I attempted CKAD (which came after CKA for me), I started inspecting the API calls. Users on Reddit pointed out that that exams are automatically marked and I wondered if there&amp;rsquo;s a way to figure out scores before 24 hour period.</description>
